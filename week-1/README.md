# Week 1: Introduction to Course & Front-end Tooling

In this course, we'l be focusing on intermediateâ€“advanced front-end web development techniques and best practices. We'll be introducing the following tools and concepts, following industry standards with a focus on the user-centered design process:

### Tools
- _**Git & Github**_ for version control & collaboration
- _**Atom**_ for hacking/text editing with built-in Git integration
- _**Prepros**_ for CSS compiling and build processing
- _**Chrome DevTools**_ for advanced CSS/JavaScript debugging

### Concepts
- **Responsive web design** (cross-device)
- **CSS authoring** (preprocessors)
- **CSS architecture/frameworks** (DRY/SMACSS)
- **HTML prototyping** (usability testing)
- **JavaScript** (interactive programming)

The goal for this course is for each student to have a basic grasp of the tooling, yet a thorough understanding of the concepts as presented and their necessity in the web design & development process.

You'll also notice a few over-arching themes being repeated throughout the course that, while not core to curriculum, will provide a better understanding of how the development process works at large.

#### Themes
- **Marketing vs product design** (website vs web-app)
- **Craftsmanship** (hacking)
- **Agile development**
- **Open-source software**
- **Contribution/Attribution** (on the web)

Let's get started by introducing the foundational concept that will help us track and share our code, **version control**.

## What is Version Control

**Version control** is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### What is Git/Github?

**Git** is the most popular version control system that developers use to track and share code.

Git provides a history of revisions or changes to files and an organization system around it

Git allows groups of people to work on the same documents (often code) at the same time, and without stepping on each other's toes. It's a distributed version control system.

**Github** is an

### Development Work-flow

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of `master` (ie: `home-page-bug-fix`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push (ie. sync) your work to the same named branch on Github
- When you need feedback or help, create an issue and mention myself and/or another student using the @username syntax (ie, @micjamking)
- When you are ready to submit your code assignment, open a pull request on the Github website
  - Have 2 other students review the work by mentioning them using the @username syntax in your pull request description (not the title!)
  - If your classmates find any issues, make the fixes locally and push the changes to the same remote branch
  - Once your code has been reviewed by 2 classmates and your code is ready to turn in, create a new comment on your pull request with the words `@micjamking: Final Submission`; this will send me a notification that your assignment is ready to be graded.
