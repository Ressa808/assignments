# Week 1: Introduction to Front-end Tools

## Git & Github

### What is Git?

### Development Work-flow

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of `master` (ie: `new-oauth2-scopes`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push (ie. sync) your work to the same named branch on Github
- When you need feedback or help, create an issue and mention myself and/or another student using the @username syntax (ie, @micjamking)
- When you are ready to submit your code assignment, have 2 other students review and signed off on the work, you can merge it into master
- If you think your code is ready to turn in, open a pull request on the Github website
- Once it is merged and pushed to ‘master’, you can and should deploy immediately
