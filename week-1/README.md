### What is Git?

### Development Work-flow

- Anything in the `master` branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of `master` (ie: `home-page-bug-fix`)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push (ie. sync) your work to the same named branch on Github
- When you need feedback or help, create an issue and mention myself and/or another student using the @username syntax (ie, @micjamking)
- When you are ready to submit your code assignment, open a pull request on the Github website
  - Have 2 other students review the work by mentioning them using the @username syntax in your pull request description (not the title!)
  - If your classmates find any issues, make the fixes locally and push the changes to the same remote branch
  - Once your code has been reviewed by 2 classmates and your code is ready to turn in, create a new comment on your pull request with the words `@micjamking: Final Submission`; this will send me a notification that your assignment is ready to be graded.
