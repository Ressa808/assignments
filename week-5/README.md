# Week 4: CSS Architecture & Frameworks

Replicating visual designs perfectly in code is just one side and challenge of writing CSS. As you begin to write CSS for larger sites and applications, additional considerations need to be taken in to account, including:

- Is the code readable/understandable?
- Is the code easy to change or extend?
- Is the code well decoupled?
- Will the code scale?

By focusing on good CSS architecture, we can answer yes to the above questions and have confidence that our code will stand the test of time.
